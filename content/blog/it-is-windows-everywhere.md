## The song

The [nice song](https://youtu.be/WEjqxOinvdg) is called "Shababeik" which means windows.
Sung by [Mohamed Mounir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohamed_Mounir). The poet
Magdy Naguib thought about it while he was politically imprisoned for opposing
the controversial yet widely influencial Egyptian president
[Nasser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamal_Abdel_Nasser) who ruled from
1954 till 1962. The poet was deeply affected by being imprisoned with no trial as
a form of political tyranny. Although he was a supporter of Nasser and just wanted
to express opinion, he was still falsly imprisoned.

- _Ghayyart yama kteir, yama kteir ahwaly._
- **How many times I changed myself.**

- _Wana kont aashek, aashek w kan yehlaly._
