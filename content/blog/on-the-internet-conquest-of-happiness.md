## You outgrow your town

Sympathetic surroundings are essential to happiness. I think it’s common enough
to find oneself in a situation of recalling the song [“Creep” by Radiohead](https://youtu.be/XFkzRNyygfk)
and to be specific the part “What the hell am I doing here?". I dare say that
you -the reader- share the experience with me of finding no one to share
the interest in a specific subject you deeply care about. You find the people
and the environment surrounding you to be not just ignorant about that
subject, but also discouraging. A young person who wishes to read a serious
book is discouraged by their parents. Teachers tell them off in the fear
that these books may disorient their thoughts. And let’s not ignore the mere
reason that this fear for the young person from such book induced by the
parent, teacher or even friends is due to the mere fact that they have never
read such books and they have neither the interest nor the will to read such
books. They find that the young person’s interest in such books or topics
peculiar and not useful. The young person then, of course, will themself
lonesome and unhappy. For they seek to meet others with similar interests.

This is often the case for individuals with intellectual and artistic interests
alike. This is actually the reason brilliant students who were born in small
towns often apply for universities that are far away, for the subjects they
wish to study are not offered by the nearby small universities. These students
often move to larger cities where they can find better more specialized
education offered by people who share the same interest in these subjects and arts.

They often find in universities other individuals who seek to learn the
same subjects. This sparks enjoyable and fruitful conversations. These
conversations embark a great deal of happiness. They share internal
jokes. They agree and also disagree on opinions. They share and compare
sources of knowledge. These experiences would have been impossible in
their original environment of the small town.

If one is lucky then after university, one can find a job in the same
field. In such a job one should meet other individuals who share the
same interests and the same enjoyable experiences should continue.
Such jobs, of course, will hardly be found in the small town they were born in.
The more specialized the fields of interest are, the more these jobs lean to
be located only in big cities with immense communities and specialized
fields of trades.

These individuals clearly outgrow their hometowns They clearly grow at a
rate that is faster than the rate of the small towns they were born in.
Other individuals however find no reason to be unhappy in their small towns.
Why would they, if all they seek is to be found near enough. The professions
they seek do exist in that small town. All the knowledge they wish to acquire
can be well acquired in the nearby schools and libraries. They hardly feel
lonely due to the lack of people with similar interests because they can find
a reasonable number of people who share the same interests as they do.
Those people are said to live within the boundaries of their hometowns

Some individuals on the other hand, as explained by Bertrand Russel in his
book “The conquest of happiness” Chapter IX, don’t have the means to move
to big cities. For various reasons, they can’t move to attend a university
far away from home. They can’t seek a job in the big city where they can
meet individuals with similar artistic or intellectual interests. They know
from books and papers that there are opportunities out there in the faraway
big cities that suit their intellectual abilities, yet they find themselves
incapable of seeking such opportunities due to various factors. Thus they
remain unhappy and lonesome. Russel mentions that something needs to be done
to help such individuals. Of course, Russel having died in 1970, hasn’t
witnessed the effects of the internet and the opportunities it offers as
a resolution for this dilemma.

## The wonders of the internet

We now of course have the privilege of the internet. A place where a young
person with an interest in a subject that is not being taught in the nearby
school is able to search for information in that subject online. An artist is
able to follow other artists on social media platforms and scroll through the
pages and pages of artwork that would never be found in the nearby art galleries.

The internet has made it even possible to work entirely remotely from the
comfort of your home for employers that reside in those big cities which
you can not move to.

On the internet, one can find communities specialized in any subject that
comes to mind. One can satisfy curiosity regarding any subject and have
those meaningful conversations one misses in the small towns. It’s even
international. One can seek specialized fields of knowledge that only reside
across the borders in different countries with ease.

## The ugly side

The ugly side of the equation is that even though those specialized communities
exist, one still feels lonesome. Despite being able to read through those Reddit
threads discussing watches which is a recent obsession of mine, I still have
the need to talk to someone about watches. I don’t understand why. Isn’t it
enough that I’ve found those individuals and all this information that I
would have never found in the local library of the small town I live in?

Don’t get me wrong. I’m still grateful for the opportunity to have an internet
access. Despite the hardships of remote work, I’m grateful for the opportunity
to work with an international company from the comfort of my own home. I’m happy
about the fact that I can meet those interesting people from all over the world
through the internet. Despite the ugliness and the nonmagical experience of
browsing through the kindle store for a book to read, I’m still grateful for
the mere fact that I can browse and read those books which I could have never
been able to read in the local libraries or bookshops. Nonetheless, something
is missing.

## On being active

I’m starting to think that the reason that I find the web to become recently
tedious and boring is the fact that I’m hardly active. I don’t post on social
media. I don’t share stories or articles. I hardly connect with people on
Reddit, Twitter, or Goodreads. I only resort to scrolling and reading through
the various things I find only without reacting, commenting, or posting
something in return. I passively watch videos on youtube for hours without any
action taken on my part. I came to realize that this is not a proper way of
communication. I’m being passive. I’m using the internet as a method of
communication to the proper extent. I’m only being on the receiving end of
information. To phrase it as Russel has done, I know through the internet that
people with similar interests do exist in some other places, but I can not
converse or indulge in conversations with them. As it was the case of that
individual who lived in the small town he grew up in and found an interest
through the available books that is not shared with any near person.

As a matter of fact, the internet has far more resources on any topic than a
library in a small town could ever have. So with the wider access to
information that the internet makes me capable of, and with me being passive
and only consuming resources found online without getting involved in online
communities. I’m far worse. As I’ve far outgrown my town in the subjects I
care about than I could possibly have with no internet access.
