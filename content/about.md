My name is Ahmed Abouzied. I'm a self taught software engineer with interest in OS development and virtualization. Currently I'm happily employed at [Adjust](https://adjust.com). Reach out to me over [email](mailto:email@aabouzied.com). You can follow my work on [Github](https://github.com/ahmedaabouzied).

I blog about Go, Rust, problem solving and often I just blog about my thoughts on random subjects. Don't take things being written here very seriously.
